## Summary
This document maps out the CVSS details for a potential command injection vulnerability in the github/docs repository. The vulnerability has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected component due to its ability to allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.

## Recommendations
- Immediate assessment and patching of the affected components.
- Enhanced input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection.
- Regular security audits to identify and mitigate similar vulnerabilities.
